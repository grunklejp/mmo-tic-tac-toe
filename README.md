Current goal:

- Represent state in server memory
- create bootstrapping process
  - [x] design flow chart
  - [x] generate random snapshotfile
  - [x] read snapshot file
  - [x] in dev mode, read from snapshot on startup on the server
  - [x] build testing websocket client app
  - [x] broadcast updates
  - [x] fix snapshot size bug
    - what should size be? (4bytes sequence num) math.ceil((boardcount _ 9) / 8) _ 2 = 1,195,748 bytes
    - is server or client setting wrong size? server
  - [x] store moves with sequence number
  - [x] üêû after a long time x's start to overwrite Os, no clue why.
    - SOLVED: when loading the snapshot we were loading the Os in to the X bitset, thus flushing the buffer to disk wrote them back into the X's byte range. It was intermittent because if we didnt have a snapshot we'd never call loadSnapshot.
  - [x] fetch delta
  - [x] üêû fetching delta not working fast enough on page refresh
    - SOLVED: just needed to trigger a rerender
  - [ ] snapshot + syncing loading state
  - [ ] snapshot fetching error message
  - [x] show "disconnected" message and button to reconnect (refetch latest snapshot and resync)
  - [x] set team cookie
  - [x] make move from the client
  - [ ] check win
    - [x] don't let user click on boards that are won
  - [ ] recursively check win & update state on the server
  - [x] define level specific updates for protocol
  - [ ] level selector
  - [ ] make levels show proper state
  - [x] check for stalemate
  - [x] clear boards recursively on stalemate
  - [ ] validate on server that users can only make moves on the highest level (6)
